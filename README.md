# Guython Packages
Packages for Guython similar to Python's 'pip'.

Here is where you can commit a Pull Request to add packages to the 'gpd' (Guython Package Database) to be used in Guython code files past v1.2.

Guython Packages can be called in Guython code with 'gpd import "gpdPackageName"' and can be used with elements similar to Python with gpdPackageName.Function.

Add your own package with your own function if you wish, ALL packages are scanned to make sure NO malicious code is being executed, packages are written in either Guython or Python.
